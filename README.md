# Zypsy frontend exercise

### Todos exercise

Your task is to create a todo list app.

1. Functionalities:

- User can add todo items
- Todos can be edited
- Todos can be removed
- User can mark todos as "complete"
- User can see filtered todos: all, complete, incomplete
- User can search through todos

2. Requirements:

- Use React
- Use hooks
- Add styles (Make the app nice to look at)
- The code must be accessible on a git repository like github, bitbucket
- Provide a **README.md** file with any comments you have. Assume this is the only additional information you're providing to the developer who will check your code

3. Extra functionality ideas (**optional step**):

- Saving the data (ex. local storage)
- Todos reordering (ex. dragging them with a mouse)
- Anything else you want - just let us know in the README

#### General notes

- Unit tests are not necessary but are welcome.
- Clean and self explaining code is more than welcome.
- Remember that the aim of this task is to create a working application (without bugs).
- Make sure that you stick to the conventions and good practices (design patterns etc.).
- Remember to provide a git working history (commits, branches etc).
- The more skills you show us - the more pleased we will be.
- Application does not need to be hosted anywhere. We require a README.md file with explanation how to run your application.

_Good luck!_
